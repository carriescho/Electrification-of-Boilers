d conditions of 
this pe

er the Clean Air Act, except 
those, if any, that are specifically designated as not being federally enforceable in 
this permit pursuant to Section 39.
5(7)(m) of the A
ct.  [S
ection 39.5(6)(a) of the Act]
 
 
b.
 
After the applicable CAAPP permit or renewa
l appl
ication submittal date, as specified in 
Section 39.5(5) of the Act, the source shall not operate this CAAPP source without a 
CAAPP permit unless the c
omplete CAAPP pe
rmit or
 
renewal application for such source has 
been timely submitted to the IEPA.  
[Secti
on 39.5(6)(b) of the Act]
 
 
c.
 
No Owner or Operator of the CAAPP source shall cause or threaten or allow the continued 
operation of an emission source 
during malfuncti
on or b
reakdown of the emission source or 
related air pollution control equipment if
 
such 
operation would cause a violation of the 
standards or limitations applicable to the source, unless this CAAPP permit granted to 
the source provides fo
r such operation
 
consis
tent with the Act and applicable Illinois 
Pollution Control Board regulations
.  [Se
ction 39.5(6)(c) of the Act]
 
 
d.
 
Pursuant to Section 39.5(7)(g) of the Act, emissions from the source are not allowed to 
exceed any allowances that th
e source lawfull
y holds
 
under Title IV of the Clean Air Act 
or the regulations promulgated thereunde
r, con
sistent with Section 39.5(17) of the Act 
and applicable requirements, if any.
 
 
2.
 
Emergency Provisions
 
 
Pursuant to Section 39.5(7)(k) of the Act, th
e Owner or Opera
tor of 
the CAAPP source may provide 
an affirmative defense of emergency to an action
 
broug
ht for noncompliance with technology
-
based 
emission limitations under this CAAPP permit if the following conditions are met through 
properly signed, c
ontemporaneous o
peratin
g logs, or other relevant evidence:
 
 
a.
 
i.
 
An emergency occurred and the sour
ce can
 
identify the cause(s) of the emergency.
 
 
ii.
 
The source was at the time being properly operated.
 
 
iii.
 
The source submitted notice of the emergency t
o the IEPA withi
n 2 wor
king days of 
the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emer
gency.
  
This notice 
must contain a detailed description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate 
emissions, and corrective actions taken.
 
 
iv.
 
During t
he period of the
 
emerge
ncy the source took all reasonable steps to minimize 
levels of emissions that
 
excee
ded the emission limitations, standards, or 
requirements in this permit.
 
 
b.
 

ation arising 
fr
om sudd
en and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, such
 
as 
an
 
act of God, that requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and 
that causes the source to exceed a technology
-
based emission l
imitation under 
this 
pe
rmit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency
.  An 
emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed 
equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper 
operation, or op
eration
 
error.
 
 
c.
 
In any enforcement proceeding, the source seeking to establish th
e occu
rrence of an 
emergency has the burden of proof.  This provision is in addition to any emergency or 
upset provision contained in any applicable require
ment.  This prov

Title I Conditions
 
 
Pursuant to Sections 39(a), 39(f), and 39.5(7)(a) of the Act, as generally identified below, 
this 
CAAPP permit may contain certain conditions that relate to requirements arising from the 
construction or 
modification of 
emissio
n u
nits at this source.  These requirements derive from 
permitting programs authorized under Title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA) 
and regulations 
thereunder, and Title X of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act) and regulation
s 
implementing t
he same
.  
Such requirements, including the New Source Review programs for both 
major (i.e., PSD and nonattainment areas) and minor sour
ces, are implemented by the IEPA.
 
 
a.
 
This permit may contain conditions that reflect requirements origin
ally established
 
in 
con
str
uction permits previously issued for this source.  These conditions include 
requirements from preconstruction permits issued 
pursuant to regulations approved or 
promulgated by USEPA under Title I of the CAA, as well as requirement
s contained with
in 
cons
tru
ction permits issued pursuant to state law authority under Title X of the Act.  
Accordingly, all such conditions are incorpor
ated into this CAAPP permit by virtue of 

plicable require

n 
a
ccordance with Section 39.5 of the Act.  These conditions are identifiable herein by a 
designation to their origin of authori
ty.
 
 
b.
 
This permit may contain conditions that reflect necessary revisions to requirements 
established f
or this source i
n preco
nst
ruction permits previously issued under the 
authority of Title I of the CAA.  These conditions are specifically designated he
rein as 

 
 
i.
 
Revisions to original Title I permit conditions are incorporated into this permit 
thro
ugh the combined
 
legal 
aut
hority of Title I of the CAA and Title X of the Act.  
Public participation requirements and appeal rights shall be governed b
y Section 
39.5 of the Act.
 
 
ii.
 
Revised Title I permit conditions shall remain in effect through this CAA
PP permit, 
and a
re ther
efo
re enforceable under the same, so long as such conditions do not 
expire as a result of a failure to timely submit a complete 
renewal application or 

 
 
c.
 
This permit may contain conditions
 
that reflect ne
w requi
rem
ents for this source that 
would ordinarily derive from a preconstruction permit established under the authority of 
Title I of
 

 
 
i.
 
The incorporation of new Tit
le I requirement
s into 
thi
s CAAPP permit is authorized 
through the combined legal authority of Title I of the CAA and Title X of the Act.  
Public parti
cipation requirements and appeal rights shall be governed by Section 
39.5 of the Act.
 
 
ii.
 
Any Title I co
nditions that ar
e newly
 
in
corporated shall remain in effect through 
this CAAPP permit, and are therefore enforceable under the same, so long as such 
co
