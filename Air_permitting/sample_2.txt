1.
 
Prohibitions
 
 
a.
 
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any terms or conditions of this permit 
issued under Section 39.5 of the Act, to operate the CAAPP source except in compliance 
with this permit issued by t
he IEP
A under Section 39.5 of the Act or to violate any other 
applicable requirements.  All terms and conditions of this permit issued under Section 
39.5 of the Act are enforceable by USEPA and citizens unde
r the Clean Air Act, except 
those, if any, that a
re spe
cifically designated as not being federally enforceable in 
this permit pursuant to Section 39.5(7)(m) of the Act.  [Section 39.5(6)(a) of the Act]
 
 
b.
 
After the applicable CAAPP permit or renewal application submittal date, as specified in 
Section 39
.5(5) 
of the Act, the source shall not operate this CAAPP source without a 
CAAPP permit unless the complete CAAPP permit or renewal application for such source has 
been timely submitted to the IEPA.  [Section 39.5(6)(b) of the Act]
 
 
c.
 
No Owner or Operator
 
of th
e CAAPP source shall cause or threaten or allow the continued 
operation of an emission source during malfunction or breakdown of the emission source or 
related air pollution control equipment if such operation would cause a violation of the 
standards
 
or li
mitations applicable to the source, unless this CAAPP permit granted to 
the source provides for such operation consistent with the Act and applicable Illinois 
Pollution Control Board regulations.  [Section 39.5(6)(c) of the Act]
 
 
d.
 
Pursuant to 
Section 39.
5(7)(g) of the Act, emissions from the source are not allowed to 
exceed any allowances that the source lawfully holds under Title IV of the Clean Air Act 
or the regulations promulgated thereunder, consistent with Section 39.5(17) of the Act 
and 
applicable 
requirements, if any.
 
 
2.
 
Emergency Provisions
 
 
Pursuant to Section 39.5(7)(k) of the Act, the Owner or Operator of the CAAPP source may provide 
an affirmative defense of emergency to an action brought for noncompliance with technology
-
based 
em
ission limi
tations under this CAAPP permit if the following conditions are met through 
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence:
 
 
a.
 
i.
 
An emergency occurred and the source can identify the cause(s) of the emergency.
 
 
ii.
 
The source
 
was at the time being properly operated.
 
 
iii.
 
The source submitted notice of the emergency to the IEPA within 2 working days of 
the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency.  This notice 
must contain a detailed 
description of the
 
emergency, any steps taken to mitigate 
emissions, and corrective actions taken.
 
 
iv.
 
During the period of the emergency the source took all reasonable steps to minimize 
levels of emissions that exceeded the emission limitations, standard
s, or 
requirements
 
in this permit.
 
 
b.
 

from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, such as 
an act of God, that requires immediate c
orrective action t
o restore normal operation, and 
that causes the source to exceed a technology
-
based emission limitation under this 
permit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency.  An 
emergency shall not include noncomplia
nce to the extent 
caused by improperly designed 
equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operation 
error.
 
 
c.
 
In any enforcement proceeding, the source seeking to establish the occurrence of an 
emergency has the burden 
of proof.  This pr
ovision is in addition to any emergency or

Title I Conditions
 
 
Pursuant to Sections 39(a), 39(f), and 39.5(7)(a) of the Act, as generally identified 
below, 
this CAAPP permit may contain certain conditions that relate to 
requirements arising from the 
construction or modification of emission units at this source.  These
 
requirements derive from 
permitting programs authorized under Title I of the Clean Ai
r Act (CAA) and regulations 
thereunder, and Title X of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act) and regulations 
implementing the same.  Such requirements, includin
g the New Source Review programs for both 
major (i.e., PSD and nonattainment areas) an
d minor sources, are implemented by the IEPA.
 
 
a.
 
This permit may contain conditions that reflect requirements originally established in 
construction permits previously i
ssued for this source.  These conditions include 
requirements from preconstruction per
mits issued pursuant to regulations approved or 
promulgated by USEPA under Title I of the CAA, as well as requirements contained within 
construction permits issued pursua
nt to state law authority under Title X of the Act.  
Accordingly, all such conditions 
are incorporated into this CAAPP permit by virtue of 

accordance with Section 39.5
 
of the Act.  These conditions are identifiable herein by a 
designation to their origi
n of authority.
 
 
b.
 
This permit may contain conditions that reflect necessary revisions to requirements 
established for this source in preconstruction permits previously 
issued under the 
authority of Title I of the CAA.  These conditions are specifically d
esignated herein as 


.
 
 
i.
 
Revisions to original Title I permit conditions are incorporated into this permit 
through the combined legal authority of Title I of the CA
A and Title X of the Act.  
Public participation requirements and appeal rights shall b
e governed by Section 
39.5 of the Act.
 
 
ii.
 
Revised Title I permit conditions shall remain in effect through this CAAPP permit, 
and are therefore enforceable under the sa
me, so long as such conditions do not 
expire as a result of a failure to timely submit
 
a complete renewal application or 

 
 
c.
 
This permit may contain conditions that reflect new requirements for this source 
that 
would ordinarily derive from a preconstruction permit established under the authority o
f 


.
 
 
i.
 
The incorporation of new Title I requirements into this CAAPP permit is aut
horized 
through the combined legal authority of Title I of the CAA and Title X of the Act.  
Public participation requirements and appeal rights shall be governed by Section 
39.5 of the Act.

records required to be kept
 
by this permit.  [Section 39.5(7)(o)(v) of the Act]
 
 
10.
 
Emissions Trading Programs
 
 
No permit revision shall be req
uired for increases in emissions allowed under any USEPA approved 
economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading, and 
other similar programs or 
processes for changes that are provided for elsewhere in this permit and that are authorized by 
the 
applicable requirement.  [Section 39.5(7)(o)(vii) of the Act]

operating without a permit unless a timely and complete CAAPP application has bee
n 
submitted for renewal of this permit.  However, if a timely and complete application to

ed, the terms and all conditions of the most 
recent issued CAAPP permit will remain in effect until the issuance of a renewal

A.
 
Pursuant to Sections 39.5(7)(b) and (d) of the Act, at a minimum, the 
Permittee shall perform 
observat
ions for opacity on each boiler in 
accordance with Method 22 for visible emissions at least once every calendar 
year.  If visible emissions are observed, the Permittee shall take 
corrective action within 4 hours of such observation.  Corrective act
ion may 
include, but is not limited to, shut down of the boiler, maintenance and 
repair, and/or adjustment of fuel usage.  If corrective action was taken, 
the Permittee shall perform a follow up observation for visible emissions in 
accordance with Method 2
2.  If v
isible emissions continue, then measurements 
of opacity in accordance with Method 9 and shall be conducted within 7 days 
in
 
accordance with Condition 2.4.

This blood is
 
processed further to recover the protein in

coagulated by injected steam in an inclined, tubular vessel
. 
 
The solids are then separated from the blood serum water in 
a solid bowl centrifuge.  The s

the Blood Dryer.  The dried produ

facility can be loaded out by either truck or rail.  For 
truck rail load out, these materials pass first from their 
respective silos to the Truck Lo

Out Air Lock.  The actual 
truck loading
 
of these rendered products takes place inside 
a Truck Load Out room where the doors can be closed during 
loading.  The rail loading is performed in the Rail Load Out 
area, which is located outside of the building
