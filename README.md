# Electrification-of-Boilers

Research goals: 
1) create up-to-date inventory of industrial boilers used in US manufacturing industries
2) determine breakdown of boiler capacities and fuel use for different NAICS subsectors and counties in the US
3) calculate the technical potential for electric boilers to replace conventional boilers, based on technology limitations
